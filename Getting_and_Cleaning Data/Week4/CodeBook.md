## Reshape2 package
I'm going to use Reshape2 package, since it's very helpful when it comes to create a tidy data. <br>
Reshape2 have two mains functions **cast** and **melt**, cast will transform the date to wide shape and melt will teansform ot to long shape. <br>


## data.table
data.table is enhaced data.frame, faster and easier.
You can learn more about reshape2 in [this post by ROLLING YOUR Rs](https://rollingyours.wordpress.com/2016/06/14/fast-aggregation-of-large-data-with-the-data-table-package/) and this [handy cheatsheet by DataCamp](https://s3.amazonaws.com/assets.datacamp.com/img/blog/data+table+cheat+sheet.pdf)
